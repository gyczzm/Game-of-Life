# Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life.

As a start, it will be implemented with UIViews and 2-dimensional array. But the plan is to continuously optimize it to use more efficient data structure and algorithm, to have UI implemented with OpenGL, and to support different rules, etc.

This is just a project for fun and practice, if you're interested in Conway's Game of Life and other cellular automata, there are sophisticated open source solutions like [Golly](http://golly.sourceforge.net/).
